# maritime_casulty_tool
Open source tool to estimate casualties aboard ships in combat.

I created this tool while a medical operations staff officer at NATO Maritime Command in Northwood, London given that all existing tools are designed for ground combat.  Further, this is open source, so that, should I stop maintaining it at some point, which is likely, others can carry it forward.
